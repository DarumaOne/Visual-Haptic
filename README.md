# Visual-Haptic
Integrating Haptic Device with Virtual Reality

This project is one of my project for my Master study. 
I'm creating an integrated setup for visual-haptic virtual environment, which is using a Haptic device (using Chai3D library) with Virtual Reality (using Oculus). 
The user will experience the interaction with a soft object using a commercial force â€“ feedback device (impedance control) and a head mounted display. 

In order to run this application, you need:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (for debug)
- Oculus Rift Development Kit 2
- Novint Falcon
